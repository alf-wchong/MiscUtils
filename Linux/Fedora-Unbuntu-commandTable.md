| **Package Management** | `sudo dnf install <package>`                   | `sudo apt install <package>`               | **DNF** (Dandified YUM) is the next-generation package manager for Fedora, replacing YUM. **APT** (Advanced Package Tool) is the primary package manager for Debian-based systems like Ubuntu.                                                                                                                                                                               |
|                        | `sudo dnf update` / `sudo dnf upgrade`         | `sudo apt update` / `sudo apt upgrade`     | `dnf update` and `dnf upgrade` are largely synonymous in modern DNF. `apt update` refreshes the package list, and `apt upgrade` installs new versions of all currently installed packages.                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                        | `sudo dnf remove <package>`                    | `sudo apt remove <package>`                | Used to uninstall packages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                        | `dnf search <keyword>`                         | `apt search <keyword>`                     | Searches for packages in the repositories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                        | `dnf info <package>`                           | `apt show <package>`                       | Provides detailed information about a package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                        | `sudo dnf autoremove`                          | `sudo apt autoremove`                      | Removes packages that were installed as dependencies but are no longer needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                        | `sudo dnf clean all`                           | `sudo apt clean`                           | Cleans the local repository of retrieved package files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **System Upgrade** | `sudo dnf system-upgrade`                      | `sudo do-release-upgrade`                  | Used for upgrading the entire operating system to a newer release. Fedora typically has a shorter release cycle (approx. 6 months) and shorter support window compared to Ubuntu's LTS (Long Term Support) releases.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **User Management** | `sudo useradd <username>` / `sudo adduser`     | `sudo adduser <username>`                  | Creates a new user. `adduser` in Fedora often creates a home directory and sets up basic user configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                        | `sudo usermod -aG <group> <username>`          | `sudo usermod -aG <group> <username>`      | Adds an existing user to a group. This command is largely the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|                        | `sudo passwd <username>`                       | `sudo passwd <username>`                   | Changes a user's password. This command is largely the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                        | `su -` or `sudo -i` (to become root)           | `sudo -i` or `sudo su` (to become root)    | While both use `sudo`, Fedora traditionally encourages using `su -` to switch to the root user for administrative tasks, whereas Ubuntu more heavily relies on `sudo` for individual commands.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **File Systems** | `df -h`                                        | `df -h`                                    | Displays disk space usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                        | `du -sh <directory>`                           | `du -sh <directory>`                       | Shows the size of a directory or file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Services** | `sudo systemctl start <service>`               | `sudo systemctl start <service>`           | Both use **systemd** for service management. These commands are generally the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                        | `sudo systemctl stop <service>`                | `sudo systemctl stop <service>`            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                        | `sudo systemctl enable <service>`              | `sudo systemctl enable <service>`          | Enables a service to start at boot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
